# Scripts
A collection of various scripts I have found helpful over time.

### InstallAppsToNewOS.ps1 - Install Apps to New OS (PowerShell)
Installs a set of useful applications on a fresh OS via the [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/) package/install manager. Specific for Windows OS.

### AutoHotKey.ahk - Auto Hot Key script with generally helpful commands
Basically a list of text expansions that I find save on typing.

### DeleteOldFiles.cmd - Remove older files from my PC
Use this to keep the number of files in my download and temp folder reasonable.
